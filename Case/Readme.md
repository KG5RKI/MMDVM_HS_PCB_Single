This is a simple 3D printable case for the board. Best if printed in something more or less transparent. 
In this case the notification LEDs can be seen easily. 

You can either use the Raspberry Pi Zero lid and base (if you run the hotspot using an RPi Zero W) OR the simple base (if you connect the hotspot to an external computer via USB).
